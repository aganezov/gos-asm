# gos-asm
Gene order scaffold assembler capable of handling multiple fragmented genomes.

**GOS-ASM** is a multi-genome scaffolder that works that takes as an input several gneomes some or all of which may be fragmented, (and their phylogenetic tree, when available) and performes a scaffolding of user-selected genomes based on rearrangement analysis among the supplied genomes. 

# Instllation
For installation please refer to the [Installation wiki page](https://github.com/aganezov/gos-asm/wiki/Installation). **GOS-ASM** has been tested on Linux and OSX platforms. Windows shall work in principal, but no testing has been perfomed.
#### MGRA integration note
**GOS-ASM** allows for integraiton with **MGRA** software ([Github repo](https://github.com/compbiol/mgra)). 
Please note that special **GOS-ASM** version of **MGRA** (*gos-asm* branch) needs to be installed separately for the integration to work.
